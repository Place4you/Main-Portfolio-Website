Platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket can aid in version control and collaboration. Once your product is ready, utilize marketing strategies such as social media advertising, content marketing, and email campaigns to reach your target audience.

## Creating Digital Products

Digital products such as eBooks, templates, and plugins can generate passive income. Identify a niche where you have expertise and create valuable products. Sell these products on platforms like Gumroad, Etsy, or your own website. Effective marketing is crucial; leverage social media, blogging, and email newsletters to promote your products.

Monetization options include ad revenue, sponsored content, and affiliate marketing. Consistency and engaging with your audience are crucial for growth.

## Working for High-Paying Companies

High-paying tech companies offer competitive salaries and benefits. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are known for their lucrative compensation packages. To increase your chances of landing a job at these companies, prepare thoroughly for technical interviews, build a strong resume, and continuously improve your skills.

Platforms like AngelList provide opportunities to invest in early-stage startups. Learning from successful investors and diversifying your portfolio can increase your chances of success.
