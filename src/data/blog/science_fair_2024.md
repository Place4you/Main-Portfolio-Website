## Introduction

Ultraviolet (UV) light is known for its germicidal properties and is commonly used for disinfection purposes in various settings, including water treatment facilities and healthcare environments. UV light works by damaging the DNA of microorganisms, rendering them unable to replicate and causing their eventual death. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of UV light exposure on the viability of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common bacterium found in the environment and associated with foodborne illnesses and water contamination.

## Methodology

### Culturing of E. coli

A culture of E. coli was prepared using standard microbiological techniques. The bacterial strain (e. coli k12) used in this study was obtained from a laboratory culture collection (carolina biological) and was maintained on nutrient agar plates.

### UV Light Exposure

E. coli samples were subjected to varying durations of UV light exposure using a UV chamber equipped with a germicidal lamp. Exposure times ranged from 2 to 13 minutes, with each trial representing a different UV dose. A control group of E. coli samples was kept in the dark to assess baseline bacterial growth without UV exposure.

### Assessment of Viability

Following UV exposure, the viability of E. coli could've assessed using several methods, including colony counting assays, spectrophotometric analysis of DNA damage, and fluorescence microscopy to examine cell membrane integrity. But the way that was **chosen** was just a simple method of counting how many squares there were in each quarter of the, then dividing it by how much squares were filled with e. coli k12 strains.

Equation was as follows: x/y = z
x = how many squares were filled with e. coli k12 strains
y = total amount of squares
z = percentage of how much was covered (in decimal form)

## Results and Analysis

### Results

#### Day 3

The trial average with the most growth on day 3 was the trial with the exposure time of 13 minutes, followed by 9 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 2 minutes. The one with the least amount of growth was the control group. The average on day 3 of the control group filled 51.04% of the petri dish. The average on day 3 was less than the average of the trials with the exposure time of 2 minutes on day 3 filled 61.08%, which was slightly less than the average of the trials with the exposure time of 5 minutes which got 66.59% on day 3. This was less than the average on day 3 of the trials which got 9 minutes of exposure time. This was still less than the average of the trials which got 13 minutes of UV light exposure, and they got 73.67%.

#### Day 2

The same phenomenon can be observed on the second day as the exposure time of ultraviolet light increased, and the percentage of Escherichia coli covering the petri dish(es) also increased.

#### Day 1

The same can be said about the first day, but it has a mild difference.

### UV Light Exposure Time and Growth Trend

|            | Day 3  | Day 2  | Day 1  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0 min      | 32.86% | 31.43% | 14.29% |
| 2 minutes  | 81.25% | 79.69% | 75.00% |
| 5 minutes  | 89.71% | 88.24% | 83.82% |
| 9 minutes  | 76.47% | 76.47% | 64.71% |
| 13 minutes | 70.59% | 60.78% | 64.71% |

### Statistical Analysis

The P-value value was 0.1815498075, which means it is 18.15498075% random. Which means it is not statistically significant.

ANOVA

| Source of Variation | SS          | df  | MS            | F           | P-value      | F crit      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Between Groups      | 0.282390416 | 4   | 0.070597604   | 1.659056146 | 0.1815498075 | 2.641465186 |
| Within Groups       | 1.489350524 | 35  | 0.04255287211 |             |              |             |
| Total               | 1.77174094  | 39  |               |             |              |             |

As you can see in the chart above, it shows that there is actually a persisting trend, that as the more exposure time you go, the more growth it gets. The growth from both trial 1 and 2 also follow this trend. For the Escherichia coli with the exposure time of 2 minutes. The data had a wide range of data, from 20% to 78.57%, but only some at the low end of the spectrum (for each quarter (1-4)). With the average being on day 3 was 51.04%.

There was a T-Test conducted, and the p-value for two-tail was 0.4032869358 where it was compared to the control group. This means that it is 40.32% random and that it would not be statistically significant.

0 min vs 2 minutes:

-   Mean: 0.5103875 vs 0.61075
-   P-value: 0.4032869358 (not statistically significant)

0 min vs 5 minutes:

-   Mean: 0.5103875 vs 0.6659
-   P-value: 0.210959945667738 (not statistically significant)

0 min vs 9 minutes:

-   Mean: 0.5103875 vs 0.7306
-   P-value: 0.0425727897 (statistically significant)

0 min vs 13 minutes:

-   Mean: 0.5103875 vs 0.736725
-   P-value: 0.0566799501 (not statistically significant)

Some interesting observations were that the trials which were exposed for 9 and 13 minutes were very similar throughout all three days. And also that some trials were more random than others based on the p-value. The expected outcome was not what actually happened. The expected outcome was that when E. coli had more exposure time to UV light, it would decrease growth, but it actually was the opposite. It actually helped E. coli grows more.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the project yielded non-significant results with a p-value of 0.3117403527, which exceeds the typical threshold of 0.05. Contrary to expectations, the findings did not support the hypothesis that UV light exposure reduces the growth of E. coli. Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that increased exposure time to UV light leads to decreased growth of E. coli. These outcomes deviate from previous studies in the field, which have typically demonstrated a negative correlation between UV light exposure and bacterial growth, suggesting that further investigation may be warranted.
